		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>When you enter into a federal contract or subcontract (or help
			fulfill either if over a certain dollar amount), you have additional
			obligations beyond the usual requirements all employers face under
			federal law. The intent of the obligations is to ensure that those
			who the government does business with follow high standards of
			conduct in their business dealings, including in their treatment of
			employees. Most of the obligations overlap requirements you already
			have under federal law as an employer, but by a being a federal
			contractor, you agree to take certain actions to comply, and to give
			the government additional oversight and remedies for violations. The
			obligations apply to your conduct with all employees who work on the
			contract and in all facilities used to fulfill the contract, and the
			equal opportunity/affirmative action requirements apply to all
			employees at all facilities (unless certain facilities or classes of
			employees are exempted in advance). There are five general areas of
			obligations on a federal contractor, as an employer:</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>

		<p style="margin-left: 54pt">
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			The following sections discuss the contractual obligations assumed by
			a federal contractor or subcontractor as an employer, the conditions
			that trigger specific obligations (type of contract, dollar value of
			contract), and the remedies for violations. <u>Please note that
				unless otherwise specified, any reference below to a “contractor”
				includes both </u><u>a </u><u>contractor and </u><u>a </u><u>subcontractor.</u>
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The contractual obligations arise from a set of laws and executive
			orders<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> (referred to in
			this document individually as the “Law” and collectively as the
			“Laws”) mandating that government contracting agencies and in turn,
			contractors hired by these agencies, include specific clauses in each
			federal contract, and at times subcontracts, recognizing the
			applicability of the Laws. Each contract must have, in other words,
			an agreement to comply with the Laws (referred to herein as a
			“compliance clause”). The compliance clauses explain the requirements
			applicable to the contractor and are provided in their entirety in
			Section IV of this document.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			If a subcontract requires a compliance clause, then all purchase
			orders under that subcontract also require reference to the
			compliance clause or to a separate document which references it. Even
			if not made under a subcontract, a purchase order, if it also meets
			the dollar threshold for subcontracts under the applicable Law, must
			reference the compliance clause or a separate document which
			references it. <u>For instructions on referencing compliance
				clauses, see the introduction to </u><a href="#SectIVB"><span
				class="Hyperlink">Sect</span><span class="Hyperlink">i</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">o</span><span class="Hyperlink">n IV.B</span></a><u>.</u>
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The Laws and associated regulations are primarily enforced by either
			the contracting agency or divisions within the Department of Labor
			(DOL) - the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) and the Office of Federal
			Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). The federal agencies’ oversight
			roles include verifying that the contractor meets the requirements of
			the Laws in fulfilling the contract or subcontract. The agencies
			accomplish this through random audits and by responding to individual
			complaints.<a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>Though employees may complain of violations, only the
			government is entitled to initiate legal action to enforce the
			contractual requirements. Conversely, the Laws do not interfere with
			an employee’s right to bring legal action under a parallel federal
			law protecting the same rights, for example, Title VII of the Civil
			Rights Act of 1964’s protections against discrimination in
			employment. Put another way, while both sets of laws are for the
			employee’s benefit, the Laws that apply to federal contractors grant,
			and provide for enforcement of, rights that belong to the government;
			whereas other federal laws that apply to all employers grant, and
			provide for enforcement of, rights that essentially belong to
			employees.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>To remedy violations, the agencies can reach an agreement with
			a contractor to correct a problem, or can bring legal action in
			court. The consequences contractors face for violations include
			paying damages to affected employees, having payments due under the
			contract withheld (while possibly still being required to perform
			under the contract), fines, having the contract cancelled and being
			barred from future federal contracts. The Obama administration has
			made enforcing these Laws a priority, and the agencies’ (particularly
			the OFCCP, which enforces equal opportunity/affirmative action
			requirements) attention to federal contract compliance is growing in
			scope and frequency.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>The requirements with which contractors must comply can be
			divided into four general categories:</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>

			<strong><em>Special Note on “Commercial Items”</em></strong><strong><em>
			</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 established a
			requirement on federal agencies to give preference to acquiring <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">supplies</span> and <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">services</span> for government use
			which already exist in the commercial marketplace, and at the same
			time simplified the acquisition methods for acquiring those items.
			Several of the Laws discussed herein provide exemptions for contracts
			for “commercial items,” and/or two subcategories of “commercial
			items” which are “commercially available off-the-shelf items” (a
			“commercial item” which is widely and readily available) and
			“commercially available services” (services related to a “commercial
			item” or services for any item, which service is commonly available
			in the commercial marketplace). The government’s definitions of these
			items are discussed in <a href="#CommerciallyAvailItemsExempt"><span
				class="Hyperlink">Sections III.2.A</span></a> &amp; <a
				href="#CommerciallyAvailServExempt"><span class="Hyperlink">III.2.B</span></a>,
			herein, and where applicable, the exemptions for commercial <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">supplies</span> or <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">services</span> are noted in the
			discussion of each Law in Section III, herein.

			provided by the Department of Homeland Security - U.S. Citizenship

			is responsible for the following requirements by its subcontractors -
			that they in turn include the compliance clause in their own covered
			subcontracts and that they enroll in and use E-Verify. Contractors
			who use E-Verify must post two employee notices - E-Verify <a

			posted in English and Spanish. When registering for E-Verify, the
			employer is prompted to download both posters.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>E-Verify is required for all employees who work directly on the
			contract or subcontract in the U.S. When subject to E-Verify for the
			first time, a contractor has 30 days to enroll and 90 days after
			enrollment to begin verifying new and existing employees working on a
			contract. Once enrolled for 90 days, a contractor must verify all new
			hires assigned to work on the contract or subcontract within 3
			business days of hire, and must verify existing employees, and not
			already verified, within 30 calendar days of the employee being
			assigned to work on the contract or subcontract. Instead of tracking
			employees used to fulfill a covered contract or subcontract, the
			contractor can choose to begin verifying all existing (subject to the
			exceptions below) and newly hired employees, and if choosing that,
			has 180 days from enrolling or of notifying USCIS of its intention to
			verify all employees to begin doing so.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>Employees who normally perform support work, such as general
			company administration or indirect or overhead functions, and who do
			not perform substantial duties applicable to an individual contract
			are exempted, but may be voluntarily submitted to E-Verify. Any
			employees who have been employed continuously by the contractor since
			November 5, 1986 or earlier and any employees previously confirmed as
			authorized through E-Verify are exempt and may not be (re-)submitted
			to E-Verify.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>Participation in E-Verify does not exempt contractors from the
			responsibility to complete, retain, and make available for inspection
			Forms I-9 that relate to its employees (and in fact DHS is escalating
			its inspection and enforcement of I-9 compliance), or exempt them
			from other requirements of applicable regulations or laws. However,
			the following modified requirements apply as part of the contractor's
			participation in E-Verify:</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">(1) Identity documents used for
			verification purposes must have photos (except with respect to
			certain accommodations).</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">(2) If a contractor obtains
			confirmation of the identity and employment eligibility of an
			individual in compliance with the terms and conditions of E-Verify, a
			presumption is established that the contractor has not violated
			section 274A(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)
			with respect to the hiring of the individual.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">(3) The contractor must notify DHS if
			it continues to employ any individual for whom the contractor has
			received a final E-Verify non-confirmation, and the contractor is
			subject to a civil penalty of between $500 and $1,000 for each
			failure to notify DHS of continued employment following a final
			non-confirmation.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">(4) If a contractor continues to
			employ an individual after receiving a final E-Verify
			non-confirmation and that employee is subsequently found to be an
			unauthorized alien, the contractor is subject to a presumption that
			it has knowingly employed an unauthorized alien in violation of
			Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 274A(a).</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt">(5) No person or entity participating
			in E-Verify is civilly or criminally liable to an employee under any
			law for any action taken in good faith reliance on information
			provided through the confirmation system (for example terminating the
			employment of an individual following a final non-confirmation).</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			As part of the registration, a contractor must sign a Memorandum of
			Understanding in which it agrees to comply with the E-Verify
			procedures, to become familiar with the processes required for
			E-Verify, and to stay current concerning all requirements of the
			process. The following links provide <a

		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Discrimination/Retaliation</u></strong> - The E-Verify MOU
			prohibits an employer from using E-Verify procedures for
			pre-employment screening of job applicants. In addition, an employer
			cannot verify only certain employees on the basis of perceived
			national origin. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the
			law which created the obligation for employers to verify work
			eligibility of its employees, prohibits all employers with 4+
			employees from discriminating against employees eligible to work in
			the U.S., on the basis of citizenship or national origin. The
			prohibition applies to persons who are legally present, permitted to
			work, and who “intend citizenship”- have applied for naturalization
			once enough time of residence has passed. It does not protect against
			discrimination against persons who have not applied for citizenship,
			does not prohibit an employer from giving preference to a U.S.
			citizen over a non-citizen if they are equally qualified, and does
			not apply to positions which require citizenship by law. The law
			further prohibits retaliation or intimidation against any person who
			complains of a perceived violation of this law or any employee who
			assists in another’s claim; and, includes document abuse provisions
			which prohibit an employer from asking an employee for more than the
			minimum documents required by the I-9 as a pre-text for citizenship
			discrimination. Additionally, a contractor agrees not to discriminate
			on the basis of national origin, or retaliate against an individual
			who claims a violation of this requirement, by being subject to
			Executive Order 11246 (discussed in <a href="#ExecutiveOrder11246"><span
				class="Hyperlink">Sect</span><span class="Hyperlink">i</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">o</span><span class="Hyperlink">n III.5</span><span

		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Personal Identification Verification</u></strong> - In
			addition to verifying work eligibility, contractors whose employees
			have access to government facilities or government information
			systems are subject to Homeland Security Presidential Directive
			(HSPD) 12-Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal
			Employees and Contractors (2004), which establishes safeguards for
			verifying the identity of and establishing secure identifications for
			federal and contractor employees. The Directive requires that
			credentials only be issued: by those authorized to do so and to those
			whose true identity has be determined (two documents with at least
			one being a government issued photo id); that the person who receives
			the credential be the individual whose true identity has been
			determined; and, that the credentials be returned and/or access
			terminated when no longer needed by the employee for contract
			performance, upon such employee’s termination of employment, or upon
			the contractor’s completion of the contract. A separate compliance
			clause will be included in the solicitation and contract, and
			requires the contractor to include the clause in all subcontracts if
			the contract is covered by the Directive. The compliance clause is
			listed in <a href="#PersnalIdentVerification_Clause"><span

			Several Laws address wage and hour issues regarding federal <span

			primarily concern the minimum wages paid to employees.<a

			including the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (“FLSA”) or the
			Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (“OSHA”) however, the wage
			and hour requirements as a condition of a contract apply only to

			<strong><u>Note on </u></strong><strong><u>False Claims

			In addition to any other remedies provided in the Laws below, false
			claims and “whistleblower” lawsuits apply to fraudulent (or just
			wrong if made with a “reckless disregard” for the truth of the
			information) requests for payment under a contract as a violation of
			the False Claims Act (discussed below in <a

			Additionally, a contractor can be liable under the False Claim Act
			for violations of its subcontractor(s) or their subcontractor(s).
			There are two primary sources of liability for a false claim under a
			federal wage and hour Law: 1. failure to pay overtime compensation
			properly, and 2. overbilling under a contract (under
			time-and-materials or labor-hour contracts) for hours actually

			<strong>Federal </strong><strong><span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">supply</span></strong><a
				name="_Hlt309109996"></a><strong> contractors</strong> with a
			contract of $15,000+, and not for “commercial items,” are subject to
			the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936 (or “PCA,” which
			preceded and served as a reference for the wage and hour law
			applicable to all U.S. employers, the Fair Labor Standards Act).
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-variant: small-caps">“Supply</span> contractors”
			are those providing “the manufacturing or furnishing of materials,
			supplies, articles, and equipment in any amount exceeding $15,000.”
			This does not include goods generally available to the public in the
			open market (see discussion below regarding “commercial <a
				name="_Hlt307571939"></a>items”), nor does it apply to perishable
			and agricultural products, public utilities, periodicals, or those
			contracts or classes of contracts exempted by a federal agency. The
			PCA applies to subcontracts also above $15,000 that take on any of
			the responsibility of the prime contract to manufacture, provide,
			transport, and in some cases provide parts or equipment necessary for
			the machinery used in production of the supplies or materials in the
			prime contract.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The PCA requires the same minimum wage, hours of labor restrictions
			per week (40 hours) and overtime premiums (time and a half) for time
			worked in excess of 40 hours as the FLSA (and its regulations provide
			certain exceptions to the minimum wage requirements for apprentices,
			student-learners and certain handicapped workers consistent with the
			standards provided for in the FLSA and its regulations). The PCA
			prohibits the use of employees under 16 years of age and also
			employees who are currently incarcerated or imprisoned, under a work
			release program (subject to limited exceptions). No workplaces in
			which the materials are produced may be “unsanitary or hazardous or
			dangerous to the health and safety” of the employees. The safety
			standards are incorporated by OSHA regulations which apply to federal
			contractors the same as they do to any other employer. Additionally,
			the PCA regulations require the OSHA record-keeping requirements to
			be followed by the contractor. The compliance clause for contracts
			subject to Walsh-Healy is in <a href="#SectIVB2A"><span
				class="Hyperlink">Secti</span><span class="Hyperlink">o</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">n I</span><span class="Hyperlink">V</span><span

			payments due under the contract or the government may bring legal
			action to collect underpaid wages. Further, violations can result in
			termination of the contract (with costs of replacing the contractor
			being charged to the contractor) and prohibition from future
			government contract work for up to 3 years. Additionally, a
			contractor may be jointly liable for any violations of its
			subcontractor(s), and any of their subcontractor(s).

			The SCA requires that <u>wages</u> paid be the greater of: 1) minimum
			wage under the FLSA, 2) those paid by a predecessor contractor
			arrived at through collective bargaining, or 3) those amounts
			determined by the Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division of
			the DOL publishes the results of surveys of wages by region and by
			job type, available online at <a href="http://www.wdol.gov/"><span
				class="Hyperlink">http://ww</span><span class="Hyperlink">w</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">.wdol.gov/</span></a>. These prevailing wages are
			incorporated into federal contracts as the minimum wage for that type
			of work in that area, and these wages must be met or exceeded by SCA
			contractors. (The SCA regulations provide certain exceptions to the
			minimum wage requirements for apprentices, student-learners and
			certain handicapped workers consistent with the standards provided
			for in the FLSA and its regulations; as well as allowing tips to be
			credited toward the wage required by the contract, as long as notice
			is given to the employee and the employee does receive the wage
			required by the contract.) Additionally, the SCA requires a “<u>fringe
				benefit</u>” payment, which is a national standard for an hourly rate
			required to be paid in money or equivalent benefits per hour worked,
			up to 40 hours per week, including holidays, paid vacation and leave
			time, in addition to wage payments. The current dollar value of
			fringe benefit amounts is published online at <a
				href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/contracts/sca/sf98/index.asp"><span
				class="Hyperlink">http://www.do</span><span class="Hyperlink">l</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">.gov/whd/cont</span><span class="Hyperlink">r</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">acts/sca/sf98/index.asp</span></a>. The benefits
			requirement also applies to part-time and temporary employees for
			hours worked. The benefit amount is not included in the hourly or
			regular rate when calculating the overtime premium. (The SCA does not
			address overtime premium rates as part of the contractor’s
			requirements, though they are required under the FLSA, and the
			Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, discussed below, if the
			contract is for $150,000+.) Similarly, the benefit amount must be
			tracked separately from the hourly rate, and a contractor is required
			to satisfy both the wage and benefit amounts independently of each
			other. Most established contractors subject to the SCA utilize a
			third party benefits administrator (some of whom are focused on the
			contractor or “prevailing wage” worker market) to establish, track,
			pay and account for fringe benefits rather than making the cash
			payment. There are financial advantages to this, including the
			exclusion of the benefit amount from payroll taxes. Most of the
			fringe benefit amount is used for medical benefits and any excess is
			applied to retirement plan benefits. For the current national fringe
			benefit amount under the SCA, an employer can provide quality medical
			benefits, which will also satisfy as the minimum coverage
			requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
			(2010). In order to qualify as a “bona fide” benefit plan, the plan
			must constitute a legally enforceable obligation to provide benefits
			for death, disability, retirement, illness, medical expenses,
			hospitalization, or supplemental unemployment benefits, be in
			writing, and communicated in writing to affected employees. No
			benefit contributions or taxes required by other state or federal law
			such unemployment compensation, workers' compensation, and social
			security count towards the benefit payment. With prior approval from
			the DOL, a self-insured benefit program may qualify as a “bona fide”
			benefits plan based on the same criteria as a third party plan.<a

			<strong><u>Personal Identification Verification</u></strong> -
			Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12-Policy for a
			Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors
			(2004), establishes safeguards for verifying the identity of and
			establishing secure identifications for federal and contractor
			employees who have access to government facilities or government
			information systems. The Directive requires that credentials only be
			issued: by those authorized to do so and to those whose true identity
			has be determined (two documents with at least one being a government
			issued photo id); that the person who receives the credential be the
			individual whose true identity has been determined; and, that the
			credentials be returned and/or access terminated when no longer
			needed by the employee for contract performance, upon such employee’s
			termination of employment, or upon the contractor’s completion of the

			in this case, “commercial services,” as a subset of “commercial
			items” are exempted), are also subject to the Contract Work Hours and
			Safety Standards Act (1962) (“CWHSSA”). Other exemptions are
			contracts for transportation by land, air or water; transmission of
			intelligence; and the purchase of <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">supplies</span> or materials. The
			CW<a name="_Hlt305839700"></a>HSSA specifically requires contractors
			to pay time and a half for all hours worked (on the contract at any
			location and requires including travel time between worksites in
			hours worked) over 40 hours in a week to all “laborers, mechanics,
			guards and watchmen,” regardless of where such work is performed, as
			a condition of the contract. Employees whose work is primarily
			clerical, supervisory or non-manual in nature do not qualify as
			laborers or mechanics under the CWHSSA regulations (though they may
			be due overtime pay under the FLSA).
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>The CWHSSA requires payment of overtime for hours worked on the
			covered federal contract, while the FLSA requires it for overtime
			hours worked in any capacity. If covered by the CWHSSA, the contract
			will also be subject to the SCA and the prime contract will contain a
			wage determination by category of employees. Under the CWHSSA, the
			primary problem arises from misclassifying an employee at a lower
			wage rate than is required, and then owing an additional amount for
			the difference in overtime premiums between the two rates and
			$10/day/employee in penalties (“liquidated damages,” - calculated by
			the DOL and imposed by the contracting agency). The fringe benefit,
			whether paid in contributions or in cash, so long as paid in full, is
			not used in the overtime premium calculation. For employees working
			at different wage rates in the same week, there are two accepted
			methods for calculating overtime pay. The first is averaging the
			hours worked at different wage rates by hours worked to determine a
			“regular rate” (and overtime premium); and, the alternative (which
			requires the employee’s consent) is paying the overtime premium for
			the wage rate at which the overtime hours were worked).</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The record-keeping requirements adopt those of the SCA. The penalties
			include unpaid or underpaid overtime premium pay as well as fines of
			$10/day/employee that was unpaid or underpaid overtime premiums. The
			penalty amounts may be withheld from payment due under the contract,
			or the government may bring legal action to collect from the
			contractor. The CWHSSA has its own compliance clause, and a
			contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontract
			covered by the CWHSAA ($150,000+).<a name="_ftnref8"></a><a

			Executive Order 13495 (2009) is not yet effective as a requirement,
			but will be soon. The Department of Labor has issued its final rule
			(discussed below), but not an effective date. EO 13495 requires
			successor <span style="font-variant: small-caps">service </span>contractors
			(contract covered by the Service Contract Act, see discussion in <a
				href="#ServiceContractsover2500"><span class="Hyperlink">Secti</span><span

				class="Hyperlink"> </span><span class="Hyperlink">III.2.B</span></a>) to
			offer employment to those workers who performed the same services at
			the same facilities under the previous contract. A successor
			contractor and its subcontractors must offer a right of first refusal
			for employment to perform the same services, to the predecessor
			contractor’s and subcontractor’s employees, who were employed during
			the final month of the predecessor contract, worked exclusively on a
			federal contract(s), <u>and</u> who would be displaced from their
			employment by the predecessor contractor’s loss of the contract. The
			obligation does not apply to managerial or supervisory employees. The
			obligation lasts for 90 days from the first day services are
			performed under the successor contract, and the offer of employment
			must be kept open for at least 10 days. Contracts (and subcontracts
			even if the prime contract is subject to EO 13495) below the
			simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000+) are exempt from the
			requirements, as are contracts performed by workers who are blind or
			severely disabled.<a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			Subcontracts for $150,000+ are also subject to the Executive Order
			and a compliance clause for subcontracts is included in <a
				href="#EO13495_CC"><span class="Hyperlink">Sectio</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">n</span><span class="Hyperlink"> </span><span
				class="Hyperlink">I</span><span class="Hyperlink">V</span><span

				class="Hyperlink">D</span></a>, herein. Successor contractors subject to
			the Executive Order and who discontinue any subcontract for services
			under the predecessor contract to perform the work directly must
			extend an offer of employment to predecessor subcontractor employees
			who would be displaced by the predecessor subcontractor’s loss of the
			subcontract.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Rules for offers and employment of
					predecessor contractor’s employees</u></strong> - Though the successor
			contractor will normally be given a certified list of workers
			qualifying for an offer, the obligation applies whether the successor
			contractor has been given a list of those workers or not. The
			successor contractor must make the offer in a language understood by
			the worker, and may not conduct background checks or drug screen the
			workers unless required by the contract. The offer may be for any
			position the worker is qualified for, and may be at different terms
			or conditions so long as the terms and conditions are not made to
			induce the worker to reject the offer. The successor contractor must
			presume, and demonstrate the effectiveness of its conclusion(s) to
			the contrary, that all predecessor contractor employees were service
			employees subject to the right to an offer, performed their job
			satisfactorily (requires written evidence to the contrary to justify
			overcoming this presumption), and were employed exclusively on a
			federal contract. The successor contractor may reduce the number of
			workers fulfilling the contract, and limit the number of workers it
			offers employment to accordingly, so long as, for the 90 day period
			of obligation, it continues to offer all available positions to
			workers with the right to an offer of employment. The successor
			contractor may choose which workers it offers positions to, so long
			as it is consistent with other laws and done in a way to maximize the
			number of possible displaced workers to employ. Additionally, a
			successor contractor may use any of its existing workers to perform
			the contract instead of the predecessor contractor’s if, the existing

			either, engage in conduct which is against the ethical and social
			policies of the government.<a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>
			The Laws are not enforced by any particular federal agency, but
			instead by the contracting agency through normal contract audit
			procedures, or investigations of complaints. The following Laws
			require, depending the amount and level of contract, employee notices
			and in some cases policies and educational efforts for employees.
			Sample employee notices are provided which define the prohibited
			conduct and are hyperlinked in the discussion of each Law where
			applicable. Policies and educational efforts should be developed by
			the individual contractor to meet its individual needs. Note that
			posting the employee notice and developing a policy or educating
			employees are distinct actions, and the employee notice may not
			fulfill the contractor’s further requirements by itself.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the requirements to notify a contracting agency of a
			violation of the Laws contained in the discussion below, federal
			acquisition regulations require generally that a contractor notify
			the contracting agency of “credible evidence of a violation of
			Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery,
			or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or
			a violation of the civil False Claims Act”<a name="_ftnref11"></a><a

		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>An amendment (“Byrd Amendment”) to an appropriations bill in
			1989 (Public Law 101-121) later amended by the Lobbying Disclosure
			Act of 1995, places two requirements on contractors as employers.
			First, the Byrd Amendment prohibits the use of funds “procured” from
			government contracts to be used to pay for any activities which
			attempt to influence a government official with regards to a federal
			contract. Second, it requires contractors to make disclosures
			regarding the payment of funds from any source used in lobbying
			activities. The Law applies to a contractor’s employees and prevents
			the attempt to influence any agency or congressional official to
			award, extend, renew or modify a government contract. Generally, the
			Law prohibits attempts to influence a government official with
			regards to a specific solicitation or contract. The Law exempts the
			following communications, among others, by the contractor’s
			employees: discussions that are not related to a specific
			solicitation - discussing or demonstrating the contractor’s products
			or services and their capabilities or technical discussions regarding
			the application or adaptation of the contractor’s products or
			services for an agency's use; and, prior to a formal solicitation -
			technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited
			proposal prior to its official submission.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			If paying a registered lobbyist to secure government contracts, a
			contractor must complete a disclosure form (and update it quarterly
			with any changes), and a prime contractor is required to collect,
			retain and file with the contracting agency the disclosure forms of
			its subcontractors at any tier. Whether employing a lobbyist or not,
			a contractor, in its offer for a contract of $150,000+, is required
			to certify its compliance with the B<a name="_Hlt317863351"></a>yrd
			Amendment’s prohibition of using procured funds in lobbying
			activities (as set out in <a
				href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_200_206.html#wp1137684"><span

			to collect and retain certifications of compliance from its
			subcontractors at any tier whose subcontract is $150,000+.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The Byrd Amendment applies to all contracts and subcontracts of
			$150,000+. Violations of the prohibition of using procured funds for
			lobbying activities and failures to make accurate disclosures and

		<p>The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949,
			as amended, prohibits a contractor from retaliating in any way
			against an employee who discloses “a substantial violation of law
			related to a contract (including the competition for or negotiation
			of a contract).” The Law does not provide for a private right of
			legal action, but allows the contracting agency to order
			re-instatement, back pay and costs incurred by an employee in
			bringing a complaint, as a remedy for the retaliation.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<a name="FalseClaimsAct_Dsic"></a>To deal with contractors providing
			sub-standard horses, armaments and food to the Union Army in the
			Civil War, the False Claims Act (“FCA”, as amended) was passed in
			1863 to specifically address fraud in any government contract.<a
				name="_ftnref16"></a><a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> The law survives,
			and prohibits submission of false claims for payment by making or
			causing to be made, a claim for payment which the person “knows or
			has reason to know” is false; which includes a “reckless disregard”
			or “deliberate ignorance” of the truth or falsity of the information
			submitted to the government, or the omission of a material fact which
			creates a mistaken impression of the truth. The FCA states that no
			intent to defraud is required.<a name="_ftnref17"></a><a
				href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> Penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per
			occurrence, damages of 3 times the loss sustained by the government
			from the false claim, and reimbursement of costs of bringing the
			claim in court apply to a violator.<a name="_ftnref18"></a><a
				href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> The FCA is most often used in Healthcare and
			Defense contracting violations, but has been used in false
			submissions of labor costs (violations of the Wage and Hour
			requirements discussed above) - <a name="_Hlt315943882"></a>compliance
			with such Laws is made a term or condition of the contract, and
			therefore asking for payment while in violation of one of the Laws,
			is a false assertion of compliance with the contract on which payment
			is based.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			Central to the enforcement of FCA violations are “whistleblower”
			lawsuits. A private party can bring a <em>Qui Tam</em> action against
			the violating contractor for themselves and the government, and
			depending on whether the government joins the action, receive up to
			the 30% of the award against the violator. The FCA protects employees
			and subcontractors who act in furtherance “to stop 1 or more
			violation” of the FCA, from retaliation in any term or condition of
			employment or the subcontract, by allowing an award of
			re-instatement, twice the amount of back pay owed and attorney’s fees
			to bring a retaliation claim.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			There are no employee notices<a name="_ftnref19"></a><a
				href="#_ftn19">[19]</a> or compliance clauses required under the
			“whistleblower” Laws discussed here. However, a contractor can be
			liable under the FCA for violations of its subcontractor(s), which
			places the responsibility on the contractor to monitor the work or
			products and billing of its subcontractors for compliance with the
			terms of the prime and subcontract.

			Federal contractors are required to post an employee notice which
			describes the rights all employees in the U.S. have under the
			National Labor Relations Act. The requirement comes from Executive
			Order 13496, signed in 2009. It applies to prime contracts (made or
			amended, or resulting from solicitations on or after 6/21/2010) above
			the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000+) and related
			subcontracts of $10,000+. Enforcement of the order is handled by the
			Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP, whose
			principal mission is to enforce three equal opportunity/affirmative
			action Laws which apply to federal contractors) in coordination with
			the DOL’s Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS).
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>

			<strong>Executive Order 13494</strong><strong> </strong>-<strong>
			</strong>Also signed in 2009, this Executive Order prevents contractors from
			being reimbursed under a contract for expenditures related to <em>persuading</em>
			its own, or any of its affiliates’ or subsidiaries’ employees
			regarding forming unions or engaging in collective bargaining.
			Specifically, the EO applies to commercial organizations that enter
			into fixed-price contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to
			contracts and subcontracts whenever (a) cost analysis is performed,
			or (b) a fixed-price contract clause requires the determination or
			negotiation of costs. The Executive Order allows reimbursement of
			expenses for labor-management committees and employee educational
			material, so long as it does not attempt to persuade employees
			regarding labor rights. The <a

		<p>
			These Laws impose equal opportunity requirements <em>in addition</em>
			to those that you (may) already have as an employer, not in place of
			them. (Generally, the equal employment opportunity laws apply to all
			employers with 15+ employees). The contract obligations for federal
			contractors do not require a minimum number of employees for the
			basic equal opportunity/affirmative action requirements to be
			applicable, but they do require 50+ employees for more rigorous
			affirmative action, record-keeping and reporting requirements. The
			Laws apply to all employees and to all facilities of the contractor
			(unless exempted in advance) whether or not the employees or
			facilities are used in fulfilling the contract and the Laws do not
			exempt contracts for “commercial items,” “commercially available
			off-the-shelf items” or “commercially available services.” The Laws
			are administered and enforced by the Department of Labor’s Office of
			Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), which coordinates with
			the DOL’s Veteran Employment Training and Services (VETS) for VEVRAA,
			and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for EO 11246 and
			Section 503.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>Under the Laws, the OFCCP is entitled to view all records kept
			by the contractor with regards to compliance, and compliance with all
			the Laws is overseen by the OFCCP through random audits and the
			investigation of employee complaints of violations. If a contractor
			is found non-compliant, the OFCCP will enter into a “conciliation
			agreement” requiring the contractor to correct any deficiencies,
			including back pay awards or other corrective action, make-whole
			remedies and relief to employees. If violations are not resolved in a
			reasonable time and manner, legal enforcement actions are possible,
			which may result in penalties up to and including debarment from
			future contracts.</p>

		<p>
			<strong><em>Definition</em></strong><strong><em>s</em></strong><strong><em>
					of Government “Contractor” and “Subcontractor” </em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			The definitions of “contractors” and “subcontractors” under the equal
			opportunity/affirmative action Laws are broad, and meant to include
			any entity that holds or assists in fulfilling a government contract.
			Generally, a “contractor” under these Laws is one who holds a
			government contract for the sale, purchase or use of personal
			property or non-personal services. The inclusion of “sale” and
			“purchase” means the definition applies to contractors who sell to or
			purchase from the government. “Personal property” includes the lease
			of real property. The designation of “non-personal services” means
			employees of the government are not contractors (and not covered by
			the Laws), but essentially all other service providers, including
			those who employ service employees and those who provide utility,
			transportation, insurance or research services directly under a
			federal contract, are covered.<a name="_ftnref21"></a><a
				href="#_ftn21">[21]</a>
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			“Subcontractors” are those who provide materials or non-personal
			services to the contractor that are “necessary to” fulfill the
			contract, and those who assume any responsibility for fulfilling the
			contract. The designation of “non-personal services” means that
			employees of contractors are not subcontractors. “Necessary to”
			fulfilling the contract includes all <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">supplies</span> or <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">services</span> provided to a
			contractor or subcontractor in directly fulfilling the contract and
			can extend downward indefinitely to all subcontractors who help
			fulfill a contract so long as the minimum coverage thresholds (amount
			of subcontract or purchase order) are met.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>Additionally, affiliates, parent companies and subsidiaries of
			a contractor or subcontractor are covered by the equal
			opportunity/affirmative action Laws if meeting certain standards of
			common: ownership, control, management or personnel policies, and
			business activities.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Covered Contracts</em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>“Covered contracts” are those exceeding the minimum dollar
			thresholds of each respective Law (including subcontracts if the
			subcontract helps fulfill the covered contract and meets the
			subcontract dollar thresholds of each respective Law). Coverage is
			assumed unless the government agency believes the annual contract
			will not meet the annual dollar thresholds. That determination must
			be reviewed annually under any contract, and at any time a single
			order or purchase exceeds the dollar threshold, the contract will be
			and will remain covered by the applicable Law(s) thereafter.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Who/What is Covered</em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>Generally, if a contractor is subject to the equal
			opportunity/affirmative action Law(s), the requirements apply to its
			treatment of all applicants and employees and at all of the
			contractor’s facilities. In no cases do the requirements apply to
			contracts that affect national security or to employees who work and
			were recruited outside of the U.S. and its territories. Additionally,
			in certain cases coverage may be waived in advance by the OFCCP for
			specific contracts (by subject matter - when in the national
			interest), or for groups of employees and facilities not involved in
			the fulfillment of the contract.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Anti-Discrimination</em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>The actions taken by a contractor regarding covered employees
			may not discriminate in any term or condition of employment,
			including recruitment, hiring, assignment, selection for training,
			advancement, compensation or benefits, based on the protected
			characteristics listed in the Laws - race, color, religion, sex,
			national origin, disability and protected veteran status.
			Discrimination may be shown by intentionally different treatment of
			individuals with any of the characteristics protected by the equal
			opportunity/affirmative action Laws, as well as disparate impact
			resulting from a policy that appears neutral but has a
			disproportionate impact on individuals with one or more of the
			protected characteristics. Section 503 and VEVRAA allow giving
			consideration to or preference to disabled or veteran
			applicants/employees as not being disabled or not being a veteran are
			not protected characteristics. However, in giving such preference to
			a disabled or veteran applicant/employee, a contractor must not
			violate the requirements of EO 11246. For example, if veteran
			applicants/employees are overwhelmingly male, a disparate impact
			violation of EO 11246 is not justified by giving such preference.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>&#xa0;</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Retaliation</em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>A contractor is prohibited from retaliating against an employee
			in any term or condition of employment who objects to an adverse
			employment action on grounds of violation of any equal
			opportunity/affirmative action Law, for themselves or another
			applicant/employee, or files or assists in an investigation or a
			charge of discrimination.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Affirmative Action</em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			As defined by the Laws and regulations applicable to federal
			contractors, “affirmative action” requirements are a group of
			affirmative <em>act</em><em>ion</em><em>s</em> a contractor must take
			(job advertisement requirements, employee notices, prevention of
			segregated facilities, data collection and record-keeping, as
			examples) in addition to not discriminating. It does not require
			giving preference to any group or meeting any quotas. It does include
			taking steps to reach out to individuals with the protected
			characteristics. Affirmative action includes, but is not limited to
			the following: employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer,
			recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates
			of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training,
			including apprenticeship. All contractors covered under these Laws
			must undertake these affirmative actions as a condition of the
			contract. Larger employer contractors face additional “affirmative
			action program” (“AAP”) requirements beyond the basic requirements,
			which are discussed briefly herein.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Conditional Requirements </em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			When a contractor meets a threshold number of employees (50+) and/or
			a certain value of government contracts or subcontracts ($50,000+)
			additional requirements include reporting workforce composition
			(EEO-1, VETS-100A - if subject to VEVRAA regardless of number of
			employees), and initiating a written Affirmative Action Program, or
			AAP.<a name="_ftnref22"></a><a href="#_ftn22">[22]</a> An AAP is a
			collective and comprehensive series of proactive internal audits and
			procedures designed to ensure equal employment opportunity, by
			identifying and resolving barriers to equal employment opportunity
			where they exist. AAPs and their disparate impact analyses involve a
			high degree of data collection and statistical analysis. Preparation
			and implementation of an AAP should be guided by legal counsel, a
			consulting company that specializes in their preparation, or the
			OFCCP. The general requirements of an AAP, and the conditions that
			trigger the AAP requirements, are listed below.

			<strong><u>Coverage</u></strong><strong> -</strong> In no cases do
			the requirements apply to contracts that affect national security or
			to employees who work and were recruited outside of the U.S. (and its
			territories). In certain cases, coverage may be waived for specific
			contracts based on subject matter, when any contracting government
			agency feels it is in the national interest, or, with approval in
			advance by the OFCCP, for groups of employees or facilities not
			involved in the fulfillment of the contract. Certain other exemptions

			<strong><u>Union Notice</u></strong> <strong>-</strong> Contractors

			affirmative action to employ, and advance in employment, female and
			minority individuals. The OFCCP recognizes the posting of the
			combined “equal opportunity is the law” poster (EEOC-P/E-1, November
			2009, or the 2009 supplement if posting the earlier version of the
			poster) in the workplace in a location accessible and visible to all

		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Anti-Discrimination</u></strong> <strong>-</strong> EO
			11246 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion,
			sex, or national origin in the following matters: employment,
			upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment
			advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of
			compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship.
			Discrimination may be shown by intentional different treatment of
			individuals with any of the characteristics protected by the equal
			opportunity/affirmative action Laws, as well as disparate impact
			resulting from a policy that appears neutral but has a
			disproportionate impact on individuals with one or more of the
			protected characteristics.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Record-Keeping Requirements</u></strong> <strong>-</strong>
			EO 11246 requires a contractor to maintain all employment records
			including, but not limited to, job advertisements and postings;
			applications and resumes; any and all expressions of interest through
			the Internet or related electronic data technologies as to which the
			contractor considered the individual for a particular position; tests
			and test results; interview notes; the results of any physical
			examination; and other records having to do with hiring, assignment,
			promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off or termination, rates of pay
			or other terms of compensation, and selection for training or
			apprenticeship. A contractor must retain all employment records for
			at least 1 year (or at least 2 years for larger contractors, see
			table above) from the date of the making of the record or the
			personnel action involved, whichever occurs later. Additionally, a
			contractor should keep written records of correspondence with
			referral organizations and any other efforts made to reach out to
			minority or female applicants, as well as a log of all applicants
			(can be incorporated into any other applicant/employee flow log)
			identifying the applicant’s race and gender.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of the record-keeping requirements is to provide the
			OFCCP (and contractor) with the data necessary to determine whether a
			contractor’s employment decisions and processes are
			non-discriminatory. <u>With regards to EO 11246, and regardless
				of its number of employees, a contractor is required to identify </u><u>and
				maintain the records for </u><u>the race/ethnicity and gender of
				every employee and, where possible, every applicant.</u> The preferred
			method is an invitation to self-identify, which must state that the
			applicant or employee is not obligated to provide the information.
			The self-identifying information must be maintained separately from
			the application or personnel file, using a “tear-off” part of an
			application or a separate form. In addition to stating the voluntary
			nature of the response, the form should explain that the information
			is gathered by the contractor to comply with government-required data
			collection, that neither failure to respond nor any information given
			will be considered in employment decisions, and that the form and
			information will be maintained separately.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>The information must be requested and if provided, maintained
			for each applicant and employee, and must be identifiable for each
			applicant and employee. This requirement creates a practical problem:
			a contractor cannot consider race/ethnicity or gender in employment
			decisions, but must maintain records for each applicant and employee
			identifying these characteristics. To balance these competing
			interests, a procedure can be used in which an employee of the
			contractor who does not make employment decisions has exclusive
			access to the information linking the demographic information to the
			applicant or employee. By using a numbering system for applications
			that correspond to numbers on a “tear-off” sheet, or separate form, a
			contractor can separate the data collection and employment decision
			making functions, fulfill its promise to applicants and employees not
			to consider their information in employment decisions, protect the
			privacy of the individuals, and avoid the appearance of considering
			protected characteristics.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			In the absence of self-identification, referring to other employment
			records and visual observation are acceptable methods of compiling
			the information (though guessing, particularly about race/ethnicity
			is not required). If an applicant or employee refuses to
			self-identify and no other records are available, the OFCCP will not
			find a violation for failure to collect the data. Unless subject to
			the EEO-1 requirements (discussed below), this data is not required
			to be filed, but must be shown to the OFCCP upon request. Further,
			the record-keeping obligations belong to the contractor whether or
			not the contractor uses an outside agency to recruit or screen
			applicants. The current racial/ethnic categories are Hispanic or
			Latino, White (not Hispanic or Latino), Black or African American
			(not Hispanic or Latino), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
			(not Hispanic or Latino), Asian (not Hispanic or Latino), American
			Indian or Alaska Native (not Hispanic or Latino), and Two or More
			Races (not Hispanic or Latino).<a name="_ftnref23"></a><a
				href="#_ftn23">[23]</a> A sample invitation to self-identify is
			attached in <a href="#SectIVA1"><span class="Hyperlink">Secti</span><span

		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Internet Applicants</u></strong> <strong>-</strong> The
			regulations defining employment decision-making processes that must
			be followed come from the “Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection
			Procedures” (UGESP). These standards were developed in 1978 by
			several federal agencies, including the OFCCP and EEOC, to provide
			guidance to employers subject to EO 11246 (government contractors)
			and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (essentially all
			employers with 15+ employees). The UGESP apply to selection
			procedures used as a basis for any employment decision. Specifically,
			the UGESP require that a contractor maintain and have available for
			inspection, records or other information that disclose the impact its
			selection procedures have upon employment opportunities of persons by
			race/ethnicity and gender. In 2004, the same agencies supplemented
			the UGESP to address the record-keeping obligations as affected by
			technological developments in recruiting and hiring; and, to further
			define when the obligation to collect race/ethnicity and gender
			applies whether an internet applicant or not. The Internet Applicant
			Rule (“the rule”) applies to all employment and promotion requests
			and searches, and applies by position being filled - if using
			electronic submissions, the rule applies to all candidates regardless
			of the manner of submission. It primarily affects larger employer
			contractors who process large volumes of resumes and applications.
			For contractors only subject to the basic requirements, the
			significance of the rule is that if accepting submissions
			electronically, then for any individual (whether submitting
			electronically or not) a contractor “considers” for a particular
			position (judges the qualifications of the individual) the contractor
			is required to solicit information and maintain records identifying
			the race/ethnicity and gender of applicants and employees. An
			“applicant” is an individual who meets the basic qualifications of
			the job and at no time removes himself or herself from consideration
			for the job - two or more unanswered requests for confirmation of
			interest is considered a removal from consideration. Again,
			procedures to maintain the demographic information for each applicant
			and to separate it from the hiring process are required.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>The rule also requires that the basic qualifications of a
			position be established in advance, may not be altered during the
			selection process; and, the basic qualifications must contain/be:</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 2pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt">
			<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">i.</span><span
				style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
			</span>non-comparative features of a job seeker (e.g., three years'
			experience in a particular position, rather than a comparative
			requirement such as being one of the top five among the candidates in
			years of experience)
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt">
			<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">ii.</span><span
				style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
			</span>objective (e.g., a Bachelor's degree in accounting, but not a
			technical degree from a “good” school)
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt">
			<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">iii.</span><span
				style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman'">&#xa0;&#xa0; </span>relevant
			to performance of the particular position
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>The rule further states that for any search of internal or
			external databases, a contractor is required to maintain the date,
			position being filled, basic qualifications, search criteria, and, if
			the search produces individuals selected by the contractor, then the
			individuals produced from the search. A contractor is further
			required to maintain records of all candidates the contractor
			attempted to contact regarding their interest in the position. For
			internal databases, a contractor must maintain the record of dates of
			adding each resume to its internal database.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The UGESP and the Internet Applicant rule place requirements on
			contractors to be deliberate in its hiring and promotion practices,
			and to be able to replicate the process by which applicants and
			employees are informed, screened and selected for openings.
			Developing the qualifications for applicants, a process for
			searching, and properly maintaining records of applicants and the
			process are all necessary to fulfill the affirmative action
			responsibilities required by EO 11246. For further information on the
			UGESP and internet applicant rule see <a

			contractor subject to EO 11246 must also conform in its employment
			practices to the “Guidelines for Discrimination Based on Religion or
			National Origin,<span style="text-transform: uppercase">” </span>which
			are intended to protect individuals of Eastern, Middle and Southern
			European origin, particularly Jews, Catholics, Italians, Greeks and
			Slavic groups, who at the time of the guidelines’ publication (1978)
			were believed to be under-represented in mid- and upper-level
			management positions. The affirmative action requirements include:
			internally - communicating a contractor’s commitment not to
			discriminate among employees, fostering a workplace environment that
			promotes non-discrimination, and reviewing the contractor’s processes
			to ensure that the obligation to provide equal employment opportunity
			without regard to religion or national origin is being fully
			implemented; and externally - communicating the contractor’s
			commitment to provide equal employment opportunity without regard to
			religion or national origin to all recruitment sources. Finally, a
			contractor is required to make reasonable accommodation for
			employees’ religious observances, so long as this practice does not
			cause “undue hardship” for the contractor’s business.

			Note that equal pay for equal work between genders is a priority of

			last 50 years, still falls short of those for male workers. The
			agency asks employers to consider the effects of an hourly wage
			differential over a 40+ year career. If not for moral reasons, then
			for practical ones, for a contractor of any size, a pro-active effort
			at evaluating possible wage disparities by gender (if not by
			race/ethnicity as well) is an important consideration at this time.

			<strong><u>Affirmative Action Program</u></strong> <strong>-</strong>
			Contractors with 50+ employees <u>and</u> any single contract or
			related subcontract or purchase order in the amount of $50,000+ are
			required to prepare an AAP that describes the policies, practices and
			procedures the contractor uses to ensure that all qualified
			applicants and employees receive equal opportunities for employment
			and advancement; and, if the contractor is not employing women or
			minorities at a rate to be expected given their availability in the
			relevant labor market, the AAP must include specific practical steps
			to address the issue. The AAP is required to be updated annually if
			the threshold conditions are still met, and must be shown to the
			OFCCP upon request. There is no employee notice requirement for
			applicants/employees regarding an AAP under EO 11246. Affirmative
			action required for an AAP does not include giving preference to a
			particular group or initiating a quota system, but does include
			taking steps to advertise for, and to hire, a diverse workforce,
			including utilizing a state-sponsored job bank or workforce agency
			for employee referrals. If required to prepare an AAP, it is prudent
			to seek assistance from legal counsel, an AAP consulting service, or
			the OFCCP.

			The substantive protections afforded an applicant/employee under this

			requirements, and unless an applicant/employee is unable to perform a

			of himself/herself or others, then the applicant/employee must be

			<strong><u>Union Notice</u></strong> <strong>-</strong> Contractors

		<p>
			<strong><u>Anti-Discrimination</u></strong> <strong>-</strong>
			Section 503 prohibits discrimination on the basis of physical or

			and job application procedures; hiring, upgrading, promotion, award
			of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return
			from layoff, and rehiring; rates of pay or any other form of
			compensation and changes in compensation; job assignments, job

		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Record-Keeping Requirements</u></strong> <strong>-</strong>
			Section 503 requires a contractor to maintain all employment records
			including, but not limited to, job advertisements and postings;
			applications and resumes; any and all expressions of interest through
			the Internet or related electronic data technologies as to which the
			contractor considered the individual for a particular position; tests

			results of any physical examination; and other records having to do
			with hiring, assignment, promotion, demotion, transfer, lay-off or
			termination, rates of pay or other terms of compensation, and
			selection for training or apprenticeship. A contractor must retain
			all employment records for at least 1 year (or at least 2 years for
			larger contractors, see table above) from the date of the making of
			the record or the personnel action involved, whichever occurs later.
			Additionally, with regards to disabled applicants, a contractor
			should keep written records of correspondence with referral
			organizations and any other efforts made to reach out to disabled
			applicants, as well as a log of disabled applicants (can be
			incorporated into any other applicant/employee flow log) and all

		<p>
			<strong><u>Union Notice</u></strong> <strong>-</strong> Contractors
			subject to VEVRAA are required to notify any union or representative
			of workers with which the contractor has a collectively bargained
			agreement or other contract, that the contractor is both subject to
			VEVRAA and committed to taking affirmative action to employ, and
			advance in employment, protected veterans. The OFCCP recognizes the
			posting of the combined “equal opportunity is the law” poster
			(EEOC-P/E-1, November 2009, or the 2009 supplement if posting the
			earlier version of the poster) at all covered facilities in a
			location accessible and visible to all employees working on the
			contract as meeting the union notice requirement.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Advertising Requirements</u></strong> <strong>-</strong>
			Contractors subject to VEVRAA are required to advertise with a
			state-sponsored job bank or workface agency for applicants, and must
			maintain records showing compliance with this requirement. Your
			state’s workforce agency can advise you on the location or office to
			post the advertisements. Additionally, the DOL sponsors a career
			website that lists job banks by state: <a
				href="http://www.jobbankinfo.org/"><span class="Hyperlink">http://www.j</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">o</span><span class="Hyperlink">b</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">b</span><span class="Hyperlink">ankinfo.org/</span></a>.
			The advertisement should state that the contractor is an “equal
			opportunity employer.” Advertisements may also be made with a private
			agency or service, so long as the state-sponsored job bank or state
			workforce agency advertisement is made concurrently. Jobs exempt from
			this requirement are management positions, positions filled from
			within the organization, and jobs lasting 3 days or less.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Anti-Discrimination</u></strong> <strong>-</strong> The
			specific issues raised by VEVRAA regulations prohibit discrimination
			on the basis of protected veteran status in the following matters:
			recruitment, advertising and job application procedures; hiring,
			upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff,
			termination, right of return from layoff, and rehiring; rates of pay
			or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation; job
			assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, position
			descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists; leaves of
			absence, sick leave, or any other leave; fringe benefits available by
			virtue of employment, whether or not administered by the contractor;
			selection and financial support for training, including
			apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related
			activities; selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;
			activities sponsored by the contractor including social or
			recreational programs; or any other term, condition or privilege of
			employment.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Reporting</u></strong><strong><u>
					Requirements</u></strong> <strong>-</strong> Regardless of its number of
			employees, if a contractor has any single contract, subcontract or
			purchase order in the amount of $100,000+, the following is required
			to be filed with DOL - Veteran Employment Training Service (VETS):
			Form VETS-100A listing protected veterans employed by the contractor.
			(For contracts made before December 1, 2003 and not since amended,
			the coverage threshold is $25,000 and Form VETS-100 is filed.) The

			If employing 50+ employees, a contractor subject to VEVRAA will by
			default be subject to its AAP requirements, which, among other
			things, require an invitation to self-identify as a protected veteran
			(after an offer of employment) to avail the employee of the AAP
			benefits.<a name="_ftnref24"></a><a href="#_ftn24">[24]</a> When
			employing less than 50 employees, a contractor with a contract or any
			related subcontract or purchase order totaling $100,000+ is still
			required to file the VETS-100A, reporting on the number of employees
			and new hires since the last report who are protected veterans. To
			compile this information, a contractor must invite employees to
			self-identify in the same way it would if subject to the AAP
			requirements, but without promising a benefit from an AAP (which may
			not exist for that contractor). In either case, a separate invitation
			for self-identification should be used with applicants (<u>after
				an offer of employment</u>), and the completed forms should be
			maintained separately from the personnel file. A sample invitation to
			self-identify under VEVRAA (for a contractor not subject to the AAP
			requirements) is attached in <a href="#SectIVA2"><span
				class="Hyperlink">Sec</span><span class="Hyperlink">t</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">ion IV.A.2</span></a>. A contractor is not required to
			ask employees hired before the contractor was subject to VEVRAA, if
			the employee is a protected veteran, though a contractor is permitted
			to ask as part of a regular process of updating all employees’ other
			information. The VETS-100A report must be filed by September 30<span
				style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: super">th</span> of any year
			following a calendar year in which a contractor held a contract or
			subcontract covered by VEVRAA, and the contractor must report numbers
			based on the 12-month period preceding the closing date used by the
			contractor for the reporting period (closing date restricted to July
			1 - August 31). Further, the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of
			1998 prohibits a contracting agency from entering into a new contract
			with a contractor who has not met its VETS reporting requirements for
			the preceding fiscal year until such contractor submits its VETS
			reports (contracts for “commercial items” are exempted from this
			prohibition).
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The VETS-100A can be filed electronically beginning November 1, 2011
			at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm"><span

			<strong><u>Record-Keeping Requirements</u></strong> <strong>-</strong>
			VEVRAA requires a contractor to maintain all employment records
			including, but not limited to, job advertisements and postings;
			applications and resumes; any and all expressions of interest through
			the Internet or related electronic data technologies as to which the
			contractor considered the individual for a particular position; tests
			and test results; interview notes; records relating to requests for
			reasonable accommodation; the results of any physical examination;
			and other records having to do with hiring, assignment, promotion,
			demotion, transfer, lay-off or termination, rates of pay or other
			terms of compensation, and selection for training or apprenticeship.
			A contractor must retain all employment records for at least one year
			(or at least two years for larger contractors, see table above) from
			the date of the making of the record or the personnel action
			involved, whichever occurs later. Additionally, with regards to
			protected veterans, a contractor should keep written records of
			correspondence with veteran referral organizations and any other
			efforts made to reach out to protected veterans, as well as a log of
			protected veteran applicants (can be incorporated into any other
			applicant/employee flow log) and all requests and responses for
			accommodation by disabled veterans.

					Compliance Clauses in Subcontracts</u></strong> - As discussed, a contractor is
			required to include the applicable compliance clause(s) in all of its
			subcontracts <u>and</u> purchase orders if those subcontracts or
			purchase orders are above the dollar amount coverage thresholds for
			subcontracts under the respective Law(s). Further, the regulations
			for the Laws provide that the clauses are incorporated by operation
			of law into each covered contract and subcontract whether referenced
			in the contract or not. The compliance clauses <u>also require</u>
			the subcontractor to further require any of <u>its</u>
			subcontractors, if the subcontract or purchase order is above the
			dollar amount coverage thresholds for subcontracts under the
			respective Law(s), to comply with the <u>notice and contract</u>
			provisions, and so on indefinitely. A good faith effort at compliance
			would entail at least using the required compliance clause(s) and
			(if/when possible) pointing out to subcontractors their further
			obligations under these Laws. Many larger contractors require their
			subcontractors to attend training on the equal
			opportunity/affirmative action policies of the contractor and take
			other pro-active measures to ensure compliance with these Laws by
			their subcontractors.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong><u>Audit Process Changes in 2011</u></strong> - Beginning in
			January 2011, the OFCCP re-designated its compliance review process
			for <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Supply</span> and <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">Service</span> contractors and
			changed the standards under which a more thorough compliance
			evaluation can be initiated. By lowering the standards under which
			violations may be determined through a desk audit, the OFCCP has
			opened up virtually any desk-audited contractor to a complete
			compliance evaluation, including an on-site audit. Traditionally, the
			OFCCP has focused its resources on uncovering and correcting
			discrimination, and typically larger scale or systemic
			discrimination. The focus of the OFCCP is now equally on addressing
			affirmative action obligations of contractors, which increases the
			necessity for contractors to understand and comply with the
			affirmative action requirements discussed herein.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>If a contractor is selected for any level of compliance
			evaluation (or receives any notice from the OFCCP singling it out),
			it is prudent to seek legal counsel. When reaching the thresholds
			requiring an AAP, it is equally advisable to seek legal counsel or,
			in the alternative, a consulting company specializing in data
			collection/management for compliance with government contractor AAP
			requirements.</p>

				class="Hyperlink">http://www.n</span><span class="Hyperlink">a</span><span

			There are regional ILGs as well, which can be found at the national
			ILG website listed above. The groups meet regularly to provide
			education and discussion opportunities for and among contractors to
			facilitate compliance with the contractor equal
			opportunity/affirmative action La<a name="_Hlt305325779"></a>ws. The
			efforts made by contractors to honor the intent of these Laws,
			display some of the best examples in America, of promoting equality
			and hum<a name="_Hlt305325816"></a>an dignity in the workplace.
			Hearing about how contractors are taking the lead in promoting these
			values will no doubt inspire you. For a smaller or new government
			contractor, the regional ILGs provide an opportunity to learn how
			larger contractors with greater resources or more experience,
			undertake the implementation of these Laws. Additionally, the OFCCP
			has regional offices, and industry liaison employee(s) there whose

		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			To facilitate compliance, federal and state agencies offer resources
			in the form of financial assistance, training, and if necessary job
			performance assistance for disabled workers. The financial assistance
			comes in the form of Work Opportunity Tax Credits (“WOTC”) for hiring
			among others, disabled employees and veteran employees, <a

				class="Hyperlink">http://www.dol</span><span class="Hyperlink">e</span><span
				class="Hyperlink">ta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/</span></a>. Small
			businesses may qualify for additional tax credits for the expenses of
			accommodating disabled workers, and all businesses may qualify for a
			tax deduction for architectural and transportation improvements to
			accommodate a disabled worker.

		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			As part of the DOL and Department of Education, and created by the
			Rehabilitation Act of 1973 discussed above, the Rehabilitative
			Services Administration provides, among other things, funding for
			state agencies to assist in the hiring of disabled workers.
			Specifically, the state agencies pre-screen applicants, provide
			financial assistance to businesses for facility or equipment
			modification to accommodate disabled workers, pay a newly hired
			disabled employee for the business during the training period, and in
			some cases even pay for another employee to assist or accommodate a
			disabled employee in their job. A list of state rehabilitative

			The U.S. Small Business Administration offers an Ombudsman program (a
			free service for small businesses subject to federal regulatory
			authority - including government contractors), which assists small
			businesses in the compliance evaluation process, reviews the

			<strong><u>Instructions for Citation of Compliance
					Clauses</u></strong><strong><u> in Subcontracts</u></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>&#xa0;</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The compliance clauses are provided herein to further explain the
			employer requirements by contracting with the government. The
			definition of “subcontract” which applies to all acquisition
			policies, and in turn, the requirement to include any applicable
			compliance clauses, includes subcontract <u>modifications</u>, <u>job
				orders</u> or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements, <u>purchase
				orders</u>, and purchase order modifications. Therefore, by regulation,
			a contractor is required to include by reference all contract clauses
			which apply to the subcontract, in any written communication which
			relates to work being performed under the subcontract.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>When preparing subcontracts, it might be feasible to identify
			and cite the compliance clauses applicable to that subcontract, but
			in purchase orders, it isn’t. Most subcontracts provide a list of
			citations for compliance clauses which might apply to the
			subcontract, with “if applicable” language, or describing the
			qualifying conditions with the citation; or, reference a standard
			list used by the contractor with a copy provided or instructions
			about how to access the list online or otherwise obtain a copy. That
			list is then referenced on purchase orders, with instructions about
			how to access it. The procedure and language for reference and
			inclusion of compliance clauses should be prepared with the
			assistance of legal counsel. By understanding the requirements, and
			having a clear idea of which Laws apply to you and are required in
			your subcontracts, the time required by an attorney will hopefully be
			greatly reduced.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			When incorporating the applicable contract clauses by reference in a
			subcontract, the following citation methods are required. First, cite
			“<a
				href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_248_253.html#wp1120047"><span
				class="Hyperlink">FAR 52.252–2</span><span class="Hyperlink">
			</span><span class="Hyperlink">Clauses incorporated by reference (FEB
					1998)</span></a>” and “This contract incorporates one or more clauses by
			reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in
			full text. The full text of a clause may be accessed electronically
			at this address: <a
				href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/FARTOCP52.html#wp372482"><span

				class="Hyperlink">n</span><span class="Hyperlink">t/html/FARTOCP52.html#wp372482</span></a>.”
			Then state “Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1)
			Provisions:” followed by the FAR Clause Number(s), which must include
			the summary description of the clause and its effective date.
			Additionally, state that the subcontract is subject to the terms of
			those cited requirements if applicable.

			Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be
			posted as a part of the wage determination.</p>

		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 108pt; text-indent: -36pt">(iv) (A) The
			process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a
			reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination
			cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary
			from wage determination to wage determination depending on the
			circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices
			which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point
			schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon.
			Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated
			under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the
			General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the
			same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage
			rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained
			between job classifications based on the skill required and the
			duties performed.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 108pt">(B) In the case of a contract
			modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing
			contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract
			under which the classification in question was previously conformed
			pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate
			and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification
			by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe
			benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase
			(or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe
			benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract
			which are listed in the current wage determination, and those
			specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously
			applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are
			accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the
			performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the
			Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken
			but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause
			need not be followed.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 108pt">(C) No employee engaged in
			performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than
			the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1)
			of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 108pt">
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 72pt">(v) The wage rate and fringe benefits
			finally determined under this subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause
			shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from
			the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the
			classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the
			compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally
			determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such
			class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of
			the Act and this contract.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 72pt">
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 72pt">(vi) Upon discovery of failure to
			comply with subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour
			Division shall make a final determination of conformed
			classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be
			retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced
			contract work.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 36pt">(3) Adjustment of Compensation. If
			the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary
			wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder
			to service employees under this contract shall be subject to
			adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years,
			under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(d) Obligation to Furnish Fringe Benefits. The Contractor or
			subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits
			specified in the attachment or determined under subparagraph (c)(2)
			of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide
			fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash
			payments, only in accordance with subpart D of 29 CFR part 4.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(e) Minimum Wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment
			for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under
			this contract shall pay any person performing work under this
			contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee)
			less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair
			Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the
			Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or
			contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(f) Successor Contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract
			subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were
			furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages
			and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining
			agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this
			contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and
			fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under
			this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the
			contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was
			employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and
			fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement,
			to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the
			predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and
			any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for
			under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this
			contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the
			limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor
			or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing
			as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits
			provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with
			those which prevail for services of a character similar in the
			locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the
			collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees
			employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a
			result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance
			with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and
			parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits
			contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining
			agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for
			services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the
			collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees
			employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a
			result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new
			or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates
			and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the
			contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the
			Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative
			Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such
			issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or
			subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage
			determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial
			variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the
			final administrative decision.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(g) Notification to Employees. The Contractor and any
			subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee
			commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any
			fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or
			shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The
			poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313)
			shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite.
			Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section
			2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(h) Safe and Sanitary Working Conditions. The Contractor or
			subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by
			this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under
			working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of
			the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or
			dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The
			Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health
			standards applied under 29 CFR part 1925.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor
			performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3
			years from the completion of the work, and make them available for
			inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the
			Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record
			of the following:</p>
		<p>

			benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation;</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 108pt">(C) Daily and weekly hours worked by
			each employee; and</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 108pt">(D) Any deductions, rebates, or
			refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 108pt">

		<p style="margin-left: 72pt">(ii) For those classes of service
			employees not included in any wage determination attached to this
			contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested
			parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under
			the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report
			required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this
			requirement.</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 72pt">
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left: 72pt">(iii) Any list of the predecessor
			Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as
			prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 36pt">(2) The Contractor shall also make
			available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by
			authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 36pt">(3) Failure to make and maintain or
			to make available these records for inspection and transcription
			shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the
			case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer,
			upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the
			Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further
			payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 36pt">(4) The Contractor shall permit
			authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct
			interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working
			hours.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(j) Pay Periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to
			each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and
			without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or
			Regulations, 29 CFR part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account.
			These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following
			the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or
			accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration
			longer than semi-monthly.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(k) Withholding of Payments and Termination of Contract. The
			Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the
			Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government
			contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate
			official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the
			Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid
			employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event
			of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the
			wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer
			may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor
			and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause
			suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such
			violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the
			requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the
			right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the
			Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for
			completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any
			additional cost.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 4pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause
			in all subcontracts subject to the Act.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(m) Collective Bargaining Agreements Applicable to Service
			Employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any
			service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any
			subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective
			bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period
			in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime
			Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer,
			together with full information as to the application and accrual of
			such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases,
			to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of
			the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon
			commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective
			bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such
			agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later
			time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall
			be reported promptly after negotiation thereof.</p>

			Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified
			list of the names, of all service employees on the Contractor's or
			subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract
			performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of
			employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor
			Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer
			shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the
			commencement of the succeeding contract.</p>

			contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that
			neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a
			substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm
			ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the

			in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and
			exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of
			the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92–473, found to be

			cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the
			applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of

			withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the
			regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528.</p>

		<p>(r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less
			than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are
			employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship
			program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is
			recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized
			agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office
			of Apprenticeship and Training, Employer, and Labor Services
			(OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not
			registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the
			wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage
			determination for the journeyman classification of work actually
			performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the
			wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered
			program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's
			rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable
			ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in
			any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio
			permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the
			registered program.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>

			employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in
			tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer
			against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section
			2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor
			Standards Act and Regulations 29 CFR part 531. However, the amount of

		<p style="text-indent: 36pt">(1) The employer must inform tipped
			employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is
			utilized;</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 36pt">(3) The employer must be able to show
			by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service
			Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and
			tip credit; and</p>

			resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such
			disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and
			not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning
			of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its
			subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of
			Labor, or the employees or their representatives.</p>

		<p>(a) The services under this contract are offered and sold
			regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the
			Contractor to the general public in substantial quantities in the
			course of normal business operations.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(b) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or
			are based on, established catalog or market prices. An “established
			catalog price” is a price included in a catalog, price list,
			schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the
			manufacturer or the Contractor, is either published or otherwise
			available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which
			sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers
			constituting the general public. An “established market price” is a
			current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual
			trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be
			substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or
			Contractor.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(c) Each service employee who will perform the services under
			the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a
			monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an
			annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during
			the contract period if the contract period is less than a month)
			servicing the Government contract.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(d) The Contractor uses the same compensation (wage and fringe
			benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the
			contract as the Contractor uses for these employees and for
			equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

		<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for compliance with all the
			conditions of this exemption by its subcontractors. The Contractor
			shall determine in advance, based on the nature of the subcontract
			requirements and knowledge of the practices of likely subcontractors,
			that all or nearly all likely subcontractors will meet the conditions
			in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause. If the services are
			currently being performed under a subcontract, the Contractor shall
			consider the practices of the existing subcontractor in making a
			determination regarding the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d)
			of this clause. If the Contractor has reason to doubt the validity of
			the certification, the requirements of the Service Contract Act shall
			be included in the subcontract.</p>

		</p>
		<p>(g) If the Department of Labor determines that any conditions
			for exemption at paragraphs (a) through (e) of this clause have not
			been met, the exemption shall be deemed inapplicable, and the
			contract shall become subject to the Service Contract Act. In such
			case, the procedures in at 29 CFR 4.123(e)(2)(iii) and 29 CFR 4.5(c)
			will be followed.</p>

		</p>
		<p>(a) Overtime requirements. No Contractor or subcontractor
			employing laborers or mechanics (see Federal Acquisition Regulation
			22.300) shall require or permit them to work over 40 hours in any
			workweek unless they are paid at least 1 and 1/2 times the basic rate

		<p>(b) Violation; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages.
			The responsible Contractor and subcontractor are liable for unpaid
			wages if they violate the terms in paragraph (a) of this clause. In
			addition, the Contractor and subcontractor are liable for liquidated
			damages payable to the Government. The Contracting Officer will
			assess liquidated damages at the rate of $10 per affected employee

			contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of

		<p>this contract in positions for which employees are qualified.
			The contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of

			provided in paragraph (b) there shall be no employment opening under
			this contract, and the contractor and any subcontractors shall not
			offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having
			complied fully with this obligation. The contractor and its
			subcontractors shall make a bona fide, express offer of employment to
			each employee as provided herein and shall state the time within
			which the employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the
			period within which the employee must accept the offer of employment
			be less than 10 days.</p>

		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(c) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation
			52.222-41(n), the contractor shall, not less than 10 days before
			completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a
			certified list of the names of all service employees working under
			this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract
			performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of
			employment of each service employee under this contract and its
			predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor
			contractors or their subcontractors. The Contracting Officer will
			provide the list to the successor contractor, and the list shall be
			provided on request, to employees or their representatives.</p>
		<p>
			<span style="font-size: 8pt">&#xa0;</span>
		</p>
		<p>(d) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the
			Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the contractor or its
			subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this
			clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate
			sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the contractor

			predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this
			contract, as well as of a predecessor contractor and its
			subcontractors. The subcontract shall also include provisions to
			ensure that the subcontractor will provide the contractor with the
			information about the employees of the subcontractor needed by the
			contractor to comply with paragraph (c), above. The contractor will
			take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be
			directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing such provisions,
			including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance: provided,
			however, that</p>
		<p>if the contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes
			involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with
			such involvement, the contractor may request that the United States
			enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United

			is submitted. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of
			employment of each service employee under the contract and its
			predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor
			contractors or their subcontractors. Where changes to the workforce
			are made after the submission of the certified list described in this
			paragraph (f) (1), the contractor shall, in accordance with paragraph
			(c), not less than 10 days before completion of the contractor's
			performance of services on a contract, furnish the Contracting
			Officer with an updated certified list of the names of all service
			employees employed within the last month of contract performance. The
			updated list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment and,
			where applicable, dates of separation of each service employee under
			the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or
			predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. Only contractors
			experiencing a change in their workforce between the 30- and 10-day
			periods will have to submit a list in accordance with paragraph (c).</p>

			sums as an authorized official of the Department of Labor requests,
			upon a determination by the Administrator, the Administrative Law
			Judge, or the Administrative Review Board that there has been a
			failure to comply with the terms of this clause and that wages lost
			as a result of the violations are due to employees or that other
			monetary relief is appropriate. If the Contracting Officer or the
			Administrator, upon final order of the Secretary, finds that the
			contractor has failed to provide a list of the names of employees
			working under the contract, the Contracting Officer may in his or her
			discretion, or upon request by the Administrator, take such action as
			may be necessary to cause the suspension of the payment of contract
			funds until such time as the list is provided to the Contracting
			Officer.</p>

		<p>ARRA provides its own “whistleblower” protections for ARRA
			contract employees. The Law prohibits contractors from retaliating
			against employees who report to a contracting agency, other state or
			federal regulatory agency or the employee’s supervisor: gross
			mismanagement of ARRA funds, a danger to the public health or safety
			by use of ARRA funds, or any other violation of law, rule or
			regulation applicable to the contract. ARRA provides for a
			contracting agency to investigate the alleged retaliation, order
			re-instatement, back pay and attorney’s fees, and further provides a
			right for the employee to file a civil action for the same remedies,
			if not already met, and the contracting agency fails to do so within
			a certain period of time.</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			The required compliance clause states that a contractor agrees to
			post notice (<a
				href="http://www.recovery.gov/Contact/ReportFraud/Documents/WhistleblowerPoster.pdf"><span
				class="Hyperlink">Po</span><span class="Hyperlink">s</span><span

			protections under ARRA, and must be included in subcontracts of any
			amount which are funded in part or in whole with ARRA funds.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Quarterly Reporting</strong>. Prime contractors are required
			to report quarterly on the use of ARRA funds including, “jobs
			created” and “jobs retained” through the use of ARRA contracts and
			executive compensation of certain contractors and 1<span
				style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: super">st</span> tier
			subcontractors. “Jobs created” means an estimate of those new
			positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled
			positions that are filled, as a result of funding by ARRA, and
			reported as “full-time equivalents,” - all hours worked divided by
			the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the
			contractor. “Jobs retained” means an estimate of those previously
			existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by
			ARRA, also reported as full-time equivalents.
		</p>
		<p>&#xa0;</p>
		<p>
			A prime contractor is additionally required to report quarterly the
			total compensation (cash and noncash value) of its 5 highest paid
			executives in the year in which the <u>contract was awarded</u> if,
			in the contractor’s previous fiscal year, it received $25,000,000+
			and at least 80 percent of its annual gross revenues from federal
			contracts and subcontracts, and the information has not already been
			submitted as required by the SEC or IRS. "Executive" means officers,
			managing partners, or any other employees in management positions. A
			prime contractor must also submit the same information for its 1<span
				style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: super">st</span> tier
			subcontractors who hold a subcontract of $25,000+ and in the 1<span
				style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: super">st</span> tier
			subcontractor’s previous fiscal year received $25,000,000+ and at
			least 80 percent of its annual gross revenues from federal contracts
			and subcontracts. "First-tier subcontract" means a contract awarded
			directly by a prime contractor whose contract is funded by ARRA, to
			furnish <span style="font-variant: small-caps">supplies</span> or <span
				style="font-variant: small-caps">services</span> for performance of
